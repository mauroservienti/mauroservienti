# Who I am

Mauro is a Solution Architect in Particular Software, the makers of NServiceBus. He spends his time helping developers building better .NET systems leveraging Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and message-based architectures.

When he is not busy with distributed systems he loves to go back to one of his first loves: rich client development using XAML based technologies. Mauro usually writes about technology, but not only, on his English blog at [//milestone.topics.it](https://milestone.topics.it) and his Italian blog at [//blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics](https//blogs.ugidotnet.org/topics). He is also passionate about skiing, road bike riding, swimming, classical dance, and music, in general.
